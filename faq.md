## Why Unistack exists?

Without Unistack, it can be tedious to set up a new Bacon.js+React software project.

## Why Unistack uses Bacon.js?

Bacon.js contains a comprehensive set of tools for modelling asynchronous
programs. Most programming problems in web applications involve asynchronicity.
Hence, Bacon.js is a useful tool for webapp programming.

How Bacon.js tackles asynchronicity? Please continue reading.

Bacon.js incorporates ideas from the world of functional programming. In
functional programming, state-management problems are either absent or strictly
cornered into the periphery of the application. This tactic removes a large
class of bugs, the bugs that emerge from state management.

In addition to functional programming, Bacon.js leverages the ideas of reactive
programming. In reactive programming the world is modelled through events and
reactions to those events. This turns out to be a useful way of constructing
software programs, because the real world is full of events and actors that
react to those events. It follows that a programmer can maintain a coherent
relationship between the real world and the software she is writing, when she
thinks in terms of events and reactions.
